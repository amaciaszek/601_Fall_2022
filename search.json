    "text": "Anticipate the End Result\nThe first step in pivoting the data is to try to come up with a concrete vision of what the end product should look like - that way you will know whether or not your pivoting was successful.\nOne easy way to do this is to think about the dimensions of your current data (tibble, dataframe, or matrix), and then calculate what the dimensions of the pivoted data should be.\nSuppose you have a dataset with \\(n\\) rows and \\(k\\) variables. In our example, 3 of the variables are used to identify a case, so you will be pivoting \\(k-3\\) variables into a longer format where the \\(k-3\\) variable names will move into the names_to variable and the current values in each of those columns will move into the values_to variable. Therefore, we would expect \\(n * (k-3)\\) rows in the pivoted dataframe!\n\nExample: find current and future data dimensions\nLets see if this works with a simple example.\n\n\nCode\ndf<-tibble(country = rep(c(\"Mexico\", \"USA\", \"France\"),2),\n           year = rep(c(1980,1990), 3), \n           trade = rep(c(\"NAFTA\", \"NAFTA\", \"EU\"),2),\n           outgoing = rnorm(6, mean=1000, sd=500),\n           incoming = rlogis(6, location=1000, \n                             scale = 400))\ndf\n\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 5\n  country  year trade outgoing incoming\n  <chr>   <dbl> <chr>    <dbl>    <dbl>\n1 Mexico   1980 NAFTA     320.     952.\n2 USA      1990 NAFTA    1377.    1955.\n3 France   1980 EU       1121.     897.\n4 Mexico   1990 NAFTA    1841.    1560.\n5 USA      1980 NAFTA     960.    2419.\n6 France   1990 EU        405.    1984.\n\n\nCode\n#existing rows/cases\nnrow(df)\n\n\n[1] 6\n\n\nCode\n#existing columns/cases\nncol(df)\n\n\n[1] 5\n\n\nCode\n#expected rows/cases\nnrow(df) * (ncol(df)-3)\n\n\n[1] 12\n\n\nCode\n# expected columns \n3 + 2\n\n\n[1] 5\n\n\nOr simple example has \\(n = 6\\) rows and \\(k - 3 = 2\\) variables being pivoted, so we expect a new dataframe to have \\(n * 2 = 12\\) rows x \\(3 + 2 = 5\\) columns.\n\n\nChallenge: Describe the final dimensions\nDocument your work here.\n\n\n\nAny additional comments?"
